# Day 1 Content Standardization Plan

This document outlines the plan for standardizing all Day 1 content files across all standards to follow the consistent template structure.

## Template Structure

All Day 1 content should follow this standardized structure:

1. **Title** - "Chapter X.X: [Title]"
2. **Implementation Note** - Standard note about header template and styling
3. **Learning Objectives** - Bullet points of what students will learn
4. **Introduction** - Engaging opening paragraphs that introduce the topic
5. **Key Concepts** - Definitions and brief explanations of important terms
6. **Deeper Exploration** - Substantive explanation of main topics with supporting details
   - Optional sub-sections for complex topics
   - Implications & Importance section
7. **Real-World Examples** - Concrete examples showing application in everyday situations
8. **Summary** - Concise review of key points (1-2 paragraphs)
9. **Reflection Prompt** - Questions to connect content to personal experiences
10. **Skill Builder Activity** - Brief in-class activity with instructions

## Implementation Status

### Completed Updates
- Standard-15/15.1/student/day1-updated.md
- Standard-2/2.1/student/day1-updated.md
- Standard-1/1.2/student/day1-updated.md

### Priority Standards for Update
The analysis showed that most files need significant restructuring to meet the template. Priority should be given to:

1. **Standards 1-5** - Core financial literacy topics that serve as foundation
2. **Standards 10-15** - Most recently updated content that requires less extensive revision

### Common Issues to Address
- Changing "Overview" to "Introduction"
- Ensuring consistent section order (following Chapter 1.1 model)
- Adding "Deeper Exploration" section where missing
- Renaming "Key Terms" to "Key Concepts"
- Making sure "Real-World Examples" section exists and is properly formatted
- Ensuring consistent naming of sections (e.g., "Reflection Prompt" vs. "Reflection Questions")

## Update Process

For each file:
1. Read the original content carefully
2. Identify which sections exist and which need to be created
3. Reorganize content to match the template structure
4. Create a new file named "day1-updated.md" in the same directory
5. Revise any sections that need improvement to match template style

## Timeline

- Phase 1: Standard 1 (all chapters) - Immediate priority
- Phase 2: Standards 2-5 - High priority
- Phase 3: Standards 15, 10-14 - Medium priority
- Phase 4: Standards 6-9 - Final phase

## Verification

After updates are complete, each file should be verified for:
- Correct section order
- Consistent formatting
- Presence of all required sections
- Appropriate content within each section
- Preservation of original content's educational value and intent

## Next Steps

After standardizing Day 1 content, consider:
1. Applying similar standardization to Day 2 content
2. Creating a quality assurance process for future content
3. Developing a style guide specific to each section to ensure consistency beyond just structure
